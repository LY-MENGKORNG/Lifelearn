## **üéØProject Entry points**

In this part, we're going to talk about the folder structure in**src** folder. Let's dive in

* **`app`**: This folder is the entry point for the application and follows the **Next.js App Router** convention. It contains all the routes and pages, including layouts and components specific to a particular route.
* **`common`**: Houses reusable logic, utilities, or helpers shared across the application. Examples might include date formatters, validation logic, or constants used globally.
* **`components`**: Stores reusable UI components like buttons, modals, headers, and forms. These components are designed to be shared across multiple pages or features.
* **`constants`**: Contains static values or configuration constants used throughout the project. Examples include API endpoints, app settings, or enumerations.
* **`hooks`**: Includes custom React hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.
* **`i18n`**: Handles internationalization logic and settings for the application. It contain locale files, translation utilities, and configuration.
* **`lib`**: Stores utilities or libraries that are not React-specific. Examples: API clients, third-party integrations, or reusable services.
* **`messages`**: Contains translations or localized text files for different languages. These files are used in conjunction with the **`i18n`** folder to support internationalization.
* **`public`**: Static files that are served as-is by Next.js. Examples include images, fonts, and static assets like robots.txt or favicon.
* **`types`**: Stores TypeScript type definitions and interfaces to keep the project type-safe and well-structured. Examples: global types, API response schemas, or component props.
